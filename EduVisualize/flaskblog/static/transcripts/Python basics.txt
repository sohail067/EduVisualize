in this video we will learn Python programming language since it is one of the most versatile and popular language used in industries as well as few advanced process of boats to we will cover basic Python commands identifiers keywords and data types let's get started let us understand what Python is python is a general purpose programming language it is designed to be used for writing software in widest variety of application domain it is also object oriented in object oriented programming the program was defined the data type of a data structure and also the type of operations that can be applied to the data structure Python is easily integrated with C + + Java etc why do we need to study Python Python is very popular form of coding it is very simple and it is in demand it is used in data science artificial intelligence web development and many more things these are emerging areas of Technology which would help you further
swadisht tutorial we will need Python compiler step 1 downloading the software how to download the software go to www.python.org download the latest version of python install the setup and you are ready after installing open idle Python create a new file and you are ready start coding the first basic command is to display using print command to display a string this is the syntax print hello in single inverted commas or in double inverted commas both are correct to compile this you need to first save the file after saving go to run and click on Run module your output will appear in the Python display an integer we can write print 1234 with a without inverted commas
what is the want to save a number or a string we need an identifier what is an identifier as the name suggests an identifier is the name used to identify a variable function class module or other object there are a few rules for naming an identifier it starts with the letter or an underscore it cannot start with the digit it does not allow a person at the rate mode and other punctuation characters Python is case sensitive how to assign values to the variable with the help of equal to sign a equal to Apple inverted commas for string equal to 1 2 3 4 integer C = 1.00 for floating point then we have keywords keywords are the reserved words in Python they are used to find the syntax and structure of python sum of the keywords are print import try cannot be used as an identifier see if we try to assign value to a keyword for example print equals to 1 2 3 4 it will show an error
let's discuss about data types there are five standard data types numbers in float long in complex strings strings of words sentences list is a list of numbers strings or both the syntax to write a list is list equal to after compiling in printing list you will receive the output as this only list dictionary these are like hash tables we can also convert the data types from int to float complex numbers etc that's all
