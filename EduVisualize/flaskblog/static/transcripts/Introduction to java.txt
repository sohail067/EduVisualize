in today's weather the internet and Smartphones have become an integral part of our lives we use a phones for almost all of our day to day tasks earlier we used to shop at malls give up in front of banks and make a travel bookings at travel agencies but now we can do all this in the comfort of our homes using smartphones all of this is possible because of a high level programming language called Java hi guys welcome to this video that will tell you everything you need to know about the class based object oriented programming language Java Java is an object oriented programming language that is used in a distributed environment on the internet it is a high level language that is easy to read and understand Java is popularly used in console graphical user interface mobile applications game development and also to make embedded systems Java is also used to develop software for devices it is used not only in computer and mobiles but even an electronic devices like televisions washing machines air conditioners and so on online Java is a Computer Based programming language invented by James Gosling and sun micro systems in 1991 the language but it could be used anywhere the name of language and finally to Java in 1995 can learn any of these suggestions based on the application of language etc and lastly we have Java micro edition which is used to program Java in cell phones set top boxes handles and so on java is an object oriented programming language based on C and C plus plus however it is improved and simplified to solve the errors in programming Java files are converted to which code format using a compiler and then executed by the Java interpreter the whole Java code is run on the Java Virtual Machine which provides a Runtime environment
now the main concepts in Java are its methods and classes a method is a block of code that performs a task only when it is called consider this example while watching TV you use the TV remote to change channels each button on the remote performs a different task methods in Java are the same we can have methods to add two numbers or email a person or to convert km to metres a group of method make a class classes are used to organise code just like a fruits vegetables and clinical products are divided into different sections in a super
there are a lot of features in Java let's start by looking at them one by one it has a simple Syntax and is very easy to understand and learn Java language is robust it eliminates errors that occur in the sea and C plus plus languages Java also has features like garbage collectors and exception handling this makes Java very unique the most popular feature of Java is that it is platform independent here compilation happens in bytecode and because of this Java can run on any machine language the feature of multi threading helps Java to multitasking Java is a portable language as it can run on any platform and data types are set permanently so Java program has a fixed size of the court the last of all Java is not as fast as C and C plus plus but provides higher performance than any other language
oops concepts in Java Java has four concepts abstraction encapsulation inheritance and polymorphism in Java views objects and classes related to the real world that makes the court easier to make and understand abstraction means showing the relevant information that is needed for a task and calculation makes the Java code Secure data is stored within the classes and it is not easy to access the data the next feature is inheritance as the name suggests the attributes and characteristics of one class can be inherited by another class because of this course take less time to create the code lastly we have polymorphism which means using the same method for different tasks in Java we can use the same object or variable in two different places to the end of this video thank you for watching keep learning and stay tuned for more from simply learn
